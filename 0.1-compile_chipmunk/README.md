  option(BUILD_SHARED "Build and install the shared library" ON)
  option(BUILD_STATIC "Build as static library" ON)
  option(INSTALL_STATIC "Install the static library" OFF)
else()
  option(BUILD_DEMOS "Build the demo applications" OFF)
  option(INSTALL_DEMOS "Install the demo applications" OFF)
  option(BUILD_SHARED "Build and install the shared library" ON)
  option(BUILD_STATIC "Build as static library" ON)
  option(INSTALL_STATIC "Install the static library" ON)
endif()
```

## Build It

It's OK to add `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, but it can be specified in `CMakeLists.txt`.

Into the `build`folderï¼Œexecute `mingw32-make`.

```
CMakeFiles/
cmake_install.cmake
libchipmunk.a
libchipmunk.dll
libchipmunk.dll.a
Makefile
```

Then it is enable to compile code in this command:

`gcc .\main.c -o main.exe -L. -Ichipmunk -llibchipmunk`
